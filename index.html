<h1>Elsie & Zoey</h1>
  
  <p>"Big and little!" This page celebrates an odd pair of siblings: a German Shepherd named Elsie, and a Chihuahua named Zoey. They are both 9 years old and were adopted in 2013 by their human parents, Kelley Tanner and Nick Olbrich. Despite their size differences, they love each other most of the time. In public, strangers often refer to them as "Mutt and Jeff," referencing an old comic strip about two mismatched "tinhorns." Elsie and Zoey are very excited that they get to be big sisters to a new human coming October 2022!</p><br>

 <h2>Zoey</h2>
 <p>Zoey is a 9 year old Brindle Chihuahua (a rare coloring for her breed!), born in Mt. Olive, Illinois, on November 29, 2012. She may only weigh 10 lbs, but believes that she weighs 100. She is truly not afraid of anything. Her favorite thing in the world is food: any food. If she were a human, she likely would have been a chef.<br></p>
