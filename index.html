  <p><br><i>"Big and little!"</i><br>This page celebrates an odd pair of siblings: a German Shepherd named Elsie, and a Chihuahua named Zoey. They are both 9 years old and were adopted in 2013 by their human parents, Kelley and Nick. Despite their size differences, they love each other most of the time. In public, strangers often refer to them as "Mutt and Jeff," referencing an old comic strip about two mismatched "tinhorns." Elsie and Zoey are very excited that they get to be big sisters to a new human coming October 2022!
